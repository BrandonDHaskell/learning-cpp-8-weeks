## Week 1 - Setup & C++ Foundations

### Objectives:
* ✅ Establish a working C++ development environment (compiler + CMake + IDE)
* ✅ Build fundamental C++ skills including syntax, data types, control flow, and basic I/O

### Key Concepts:
* ✅ Syntax and Fundemental data types
* ✅ Basic I/O (`std::cin` and `std::cout`)
* Functions (overloading, default args, inline func)
* ✅ Namespace (When/Why)
* ✅ Control Flow: Conditionals (`if`/`else`, `switch`), loops (`for`, `while`, `range-based for`)

### Generic Tasks:
* ✅ Setup IDE (VS Code [Linux - Laptop, Windows - PC])
* ✅ Setup and config GCC compiler v14.2
* ✅ Setup and config CMake v3.31.5
* ✅ Setup and config Git v2.48.1

### Coding Tasks:
* ✅ Create a simple CMake project
    * Minimum `CMakeLists.txt` structure
* ✅ Hello World app:
    * Using C++23 standard
    * Using CMake to compile
    * Using `std::cin` and `std::cout`
    * Takes console input to output name and hello text
* ✅ Even & Odd app (Optional):
    * Using C++23 standard
    * Using CMake to compile
    * Using basic I/O and Flow controls
    * Console program that prompts the user for how many integers to enter
    * Reads in each integers and stores them in a `std::vector<int>`
    * Prints how many even and odd numbers were entered
* Guess the number app (Optional):
    * Using C++23 standard
    * Using CMake to compile
    * Using basic I/O and Flow controls
    * Console program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and prompts the user with High or Low each time they guess
